This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles involving the `COPY` instruction.  The original Dockerfile fails to build because the path to the requirements.txt file is incorrect or the file is missing.  The solution shows how to correctly specify file paths for a successful build.

**Problem:** The original Dockerfile will fail if requirements.txt isn't where the `COPY` command expects it, leading to a cryptic build error.
